# interactive_unexpected_events
Interactive dot plots showing predicted unexpected events. 

Data was collected and labelled for studies in [Quinn, Campbell, & Keane (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104520) published in Cognition. In this paper, we described how the unexpected events people predict will occur after everyday scenarios (such as going shopping, making breakfast, taking a trip), are largely negatively-valenced, but this can change depending on the valence of the original scenario. The data from this paper are available in a [Mendeley Repository](https://doi.org/10.17632/kkt999sn7b.1) with corresponding [Data in Breif paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.106935).

Using the data from the third study and adapting code from [this blog], I have made interactive dot plots (Ã  la [Arkes & Gaissmaier (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612437428)) with the responses for each scenario presented, colored by their labeled valence.
