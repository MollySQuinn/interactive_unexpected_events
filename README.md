# interactive_unexpected_events
Interactive dot plots showing predicted unexpected events. 

Data was collected and labelled for studies originally published in [Cognition](10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104520). In this paper, we described how the unexpected events people predict will occur after everyday scenarios (such as going shopping, making breakfast, taking a trip), are largely negatively-valenced, but this can change depending on the valence of the original scenario.

Using the data available in [Mendeley Repository](10.17632/kkt999sn7b.1), and adapting code from [this blog], I have made interactive dot plots with the responses for each scenario presented.
